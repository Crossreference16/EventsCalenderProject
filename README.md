### ***Project Overview*** üöÄ

- Our team had taken interest in apps and websites, such as EventBrite and Fatsoma, which present events for people to attend. This led to a demonstration of a many-to-many relationship between users and event, allowing us to utilise the two entities together.

Our API was coded in Java. We utilsed Git to commit our changes and contain our code in GitHub with our UML and ERD diagrams. We also used SpringBoot to implement the Spring framework, JPA to convert JSON and Java, alongside postman to test our functions.
